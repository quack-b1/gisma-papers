A comprehensive privacy protection notice was provided in both English and German. The notice outlined that the survey “is part of a university research project on language requirements in Berlin’s job market. Participation is voluntary, and all responses will be anonymous and treated confidentially, in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).” Respondents were also informed that we will collect “demographic information (e.g. age, education level, field of study) and your experiences with job searching in Berlin,” and that the results will be used “for academic purposes only and will not be shared with third parties. No personally identifying information (such as names, emails, or IP addresses) will be collected or stored.” Respondents were informed of their right to withdraw their participation at any time and that proceeding with the survey confirmed they were at least 18 years old and gave informed consent for the use of their responses in this academic study.
