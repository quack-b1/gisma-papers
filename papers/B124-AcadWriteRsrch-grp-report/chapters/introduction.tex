\chapter{Introduction}

Once divided by two disparate ideologies, the German capital city of Berlin has earned a reputation for internationalism and globalization. With its thriving technology sector, growing business opportunities, and a large community of English speakers, Berlin has become an attraction for expatriates and international students looking to start a new life or career in Germany. This is primarily due to the city’s branding as the ideal multicultural, English-friendly city requiring minimal German language skills. The ease with which one can navigate Berlin’s historical sites, university systems, and social life without fluency in German has only reinforced the city’s attractive reputation. 

However, despite this welcoming image, anecdotal reports and firsthand experiences suggest significant obstacles for non-German speakers when applying for positions outside the narrow subset of expat-based tech startups. This creates a misalignment between Berlin’s international image and the standard labor market’s linguistic requirements. While many may assume that English is sufficient to secure a job, the reality of finding employment often tells a different story. Job listings in the Berlin Metropolitan Area continue to require fluency in German across multiple job sectors, particularly in more traditional industries such as finance, healthcare, and public administration. However, this demand is also evident in international fields like software development and marketing. This linguistic requirement creates a significant barrier to entering the German labor market, thereby challenging the perception of Berlin as a truly English-friendly city beyond a tourist scope.

This paper aims to explore the question “\textbf{To what extent does Berlin’s international and English-friendly reputation reflect the linguistic requirements of its labor market for non-German speaking professionals?}” Specifically, this will be done by:
\begin{description}
\item[O1:] Examining the gap between Berlin’s image and the language demands of its job market;
\item[O2:] Investigating how English-speaking professionals fare in the job market;
\item[O3:] Identifying which sectors or industries are more accessible to non-German speakers.\end{description}
Additionally, the study argues that: \begin{description}
	\item[H1:] A majority of full-time job listings in Berlin require German-language proficiency;
	\item[H2:] Non-German-speaking professionals are underrepresented in Berlin’s non-startup employment sectors;
	\item[H3:] The perception of Berlin as an English-speaking job market exceeds the actual availability of English-only roles;
	\item[H4:] Students and early-career professionals experience greater language-related employment barriers than those in technical or international business roles.
\end{description} 

Furthermore, this paper will compare the relationship between Berlin’s online reputation and online job boards, career advisors, and first-hand job-search testimonials. The use of primary research will provide contemporary insight into the topic at hand as well as represent the diversity of Berlin’s human talent. Additionally, secondary research into this question will furthermore support this paper’s analysis of Berlin’s job market. However, it is essential to note the limitations of each method. These limitations will be further elaborated upon in the methodology section of this paper.
