\chapter{Introduction}
When applying for a Working Student position in computer science, a well-organized technical portfolio is essential for demonstrating both skills and professionalism. This report outlines the development of my computer science portfolio, accessible at \url{https://aliabdou.de}, and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages via the repository \url{https://github.com/quack-b1/quack-b1.github.io}.

The primary objective of the portfolio is to exemplify my academic credentials, technical expertise, and selected projects in a professional and accessible manner. Designed as a single-page, responsive website with multilingual capabilities, it utilizes contemporary web development tools, including Jekyll and Bootstrap CSS, to optimize performance, usability, and aesthetic appeal. The GitHub repository preserves a clean and well-structured codebase, adheres to best practices, incorporates a modular architecture, and contains comprehensive documentation to facilitate straightforward updates.

This report offers a comprehensive analysis of the portfolio's structure, design decisions, and implementation methodology. It additionally evaluates the strengths and limitations inherent in the current iteration and suggests potential improvements for the future. Through this initiative, I demonstrate my ability to translate theoretical knowledge into practical, goal-oriented applications, a vital competency for any aspiring computer scientist. \par
