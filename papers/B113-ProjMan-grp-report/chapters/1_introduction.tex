\chapter{Introduction}

The California High-Speed Rail (CHSR) project is an ambitious, publicly funded initiative aimed at developing a high-speed rail system throughout California. Conceived to address the state's growing transportation needs, the project aims to connect major metropolitan areas, alleviate congestion on highways and airports, and contribute to economic development and environmental sustainability.

The primary objective of the California High-Speed Rail (CHSR) system is to provide residents of California with a more rapid, efficient, and environmentally sustainable option for intercity travel. Its goals include alleviating the significant congestion experienced on interstate highways and at commercial airports, addressing future intercity travel demands, maximizing opportunities for intermodal transportation through integration with local transit systems, airports, and highways, and enhancing the overall intercity travel experience by offering comfortable, safe, frequent, and reliable high-speed travel. Furthermore, the system serves as a crucial component of California's strategy to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, aiming to eliminate an average of 3,500 tons of emissions annually along its 800-mile corridor.

The project's initial vision encompassed an approximately 800-mile system connecting San Francisco and Sacramento in the north to Los Angeles and San Diego in the south. Due to its immense scale, complexity, and cost, the California High-Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA) divided the system into nine project sections for phased implementation, in line with Proposition 1A, the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act of 2008. The current focus is on Phase 1, which aims to connect San Francisco to Anaheim via the Central Valley, with Phase 2 extending to Sacramento and San Diego in the future.

Key stakeholders in this monumental undertaking include the California High-Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Parks Service (NPS), and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. Local governments, freight railroad companies, contractors, small businesses, disabled veteran business enterprises, disadvantaged business enterprises, and the general public (including affected communities and landowners) are also critical stakeholders.

All information in this case study is strictly obtained from the California High-Speed Rail Authority. Individual reports are referenced at the end of this document. For efficiency, direct mentions will be marked with the acronym “CHSRA” instead of the whole phrase.\par
